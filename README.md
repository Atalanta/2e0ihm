# 2E0IHM's Amateur Radio Jupyter Notebook

Amateur Radio provides many opportunities to experiment and learn. Doing so frequently requires the use of various mathematical equations and the visualization of the behavior of those equations. It occurred to me that a Jupyter Notebook might be a convenient place for me to keep such calculations and to build a library of helpful functions. This is that.

It's my hope that other amateurs might find this interesting too, so I will aim to keep it maintained and useful to others.

## Getting Started

If you've never used [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) before, you'll need to take a few preparatory steps in order to use this repository:

- Ensure you have a modern version of [Python](https://python.org) installed on your machine.
- Install the [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) project manager with `pip install hatch`. Depending on your Python installation, you might need to use `pip3 install hatch`.
- [Clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your computer.
- In the top-level directory of the repository, run `hatch instal`l.
- Start the notebook by running `jupyter notebook`.
